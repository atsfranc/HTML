        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px">Hi there! I'm Francis from Singapore and welcome to my movie fan-page. As you can tell from the picture above, I'm a fan of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) trilogy.
        Even though the films were good, I personally liked the books better as the world that Tolkien built was much more richer and
        flavoured than was shown in the films. For example, the important (but brief) appearance of Tom Bombadil in the first book was
        something many fans of the books missed in the movies. Now this is not an ad for the books, but if you liked the movies then you
        really consider reading the books.</p>
