    <p style="font-size:20px">Hello! I'm just a simple guy with simple hobbies. Other than watching movies,
    I also like eating good food, playing the guitar, and basketball. Unfortunately COVID has put an end to
    many of these activities. I look forward to the day when we can all engage in the activities we love without fear.
    <br>
    In the meantime, take care and I'll see you around.</p>
